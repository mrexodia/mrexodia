## ❤️ Sponsoring

If you like or rely on the work I do, please consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/mrexodia). I do open source in my free time and it would be really great if I could do more of it.

## Current projects

Recently I've been working on:

- A beginner-friendly build system based on CMake and TOML: [cmkr](https://github.com/build-cpp/cmkr)
- A python library to call functions in dump files (useful for malware analysis): [dumpulator](https://github.com/mrexodia/dumpulator)
- A ghetto user mode emulator for kernel drivers to analyze an anti-cheat: [driver_unpacking](https://github.com/mrexodia/driver_unpacking)

See the pinned repositories below for more interesting things I've been up to.
